Hi! I’m Mohamad Amierul Hakeem. _Typically go by Amierul or Hakeem_

Here are my uni stats:

- Final year **MEng Mechatronics**
- University of Manchester
- 81.7% - on track for **first-class honours** 
- Graduating Summer 2026


# Story of My Life

If I have to describe myself in one word I would say im a **pragmatic** person. 

I always think of things in terms of practicality. I challenge a lot of ideas I encounter in life which had ultimately led me to taking on an engineering degree.

Why Mechatronics? Robots are cool and I wanted to do a little bit of everything.

Now after 3 years of my degree and trying out different fields, I realised that electronics is my passion.

With the current state of the job market, I wish I can still continue pursuing my passion, but only time will tell.


# My Interests

Although electronics is the core of my interest, I am trying to delve into more specialised fields.

1. Embedded Systems 
2. Power Electronics
3. Electrical Machines 
4. Robotics 

These are the fields im exploring currently _(not ranked)_.

I also do some programming as I believe its an essential skill especially in the age of automation.
